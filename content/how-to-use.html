    To download, you do not need to go through plenty of steps. All you have to
    do is copy and paste. You can either use the keyboard or mouse to perform
    this task. However, we allow an easy search of tracks by entering the
    artist's name or song without the need of adding any URL.
</p>
<p>
    Let us go through a step-by-step guide to get offline music for all ages and
    moods.
</p>
<h1>Step One</h1>
<ul>
    <li>
        <span>Search the artist, song, and playlist of your choice</span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span>
            Or open
            <a href="https://soundcloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
                Soundcloud.com
            </a>
        </span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span>Copy the URL of the selected songs or playlist</span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span>Open SoundcloudtoMP3.live</span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span>Paste the link in the search bar at the top of the page</span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span>Enter search&nbsp;</span>
    </li>
</ul>
<h1>Step Two</h1>
<p>
    Once you have entered the search, the required track or playlist will appear
    in the same window. You can either play or download it as per your choice.
</p>
<h2>For download</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <span>Click on the drop-down arrow</span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span>It will lead you to a new tab</span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span>Check the file size and click on the download button</span>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <em>
        Since we have promised you a user-friendly application, the previous
        page will have the track as it is. So that if you want to go back and
        choose another song to download from the playlist, you can do it in one
        go.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    If you have a particular song in your mind, write that in the search bar
    right away and get maximum results immediately.
</p>
<h1>How to Copy URL/Link</h1>

<p>
    Either you are using SoundCloud downloader chrome, SoundCloud downloader
    android, Soundcloud downloader mac, or any other device there are options to
    copy.
</p>
<h2>For PC</h2>
<p>
    It is easier to copy the link from the bar at the top of the page. You can
    copy the link from there and paste it here at the search bar.
</p>
<h2>For Mobile</h2>
<p>
    For mobile users, I recommend using the share option placed at the bottom of
    each track. From there, you can copy the link and paste it here in the
    search bar.
</p>
<p>
    Copying the URL is only required if you need the song from SoundCloud.
    However, if you have heard the song in a gym, way back at home and parties,
    you can
    <a
        title="Music Discovery"
        href="https://www.shazam.com/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener"
    >
        shazam
    </a>
    that song, put the track name in the search bar and let the soundcloud to
    mp3.live do it's trick. ðŸ˜‰
