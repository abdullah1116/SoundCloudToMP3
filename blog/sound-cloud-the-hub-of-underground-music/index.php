                            Tips that guarantee your popularity on
                            SoundCloud
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although your music has to play a huge part, we
                            can not deny the fact that we have to create our
                            image first. Therefore, I have come up with the
                            top best tips that would help the beginners
                            create a name in the world of music using
                            SoundCloud. Who knows, you can be the next
                            prominent artist if you want to.

                        <p>Profile Creation</p>
                        <p>
                            No doubt it is a fun app, but the artist must
                            have a well-structured profile because the
                            purpose is to move the user form one track to
                            the whole list.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For this always have a perfect profile image and
                            description that would also state about your
                            music and inspiration.
                        </p>
                        <p>Unique style</p>
                        <p>
                            There are plenty of artists on the platform
                            already, but that doesn&#39;t mean you do not
                            have a chance. You have, with your music style
                            and delivery,
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Do not get overwhelmed by seeing comments on
                            someone else&#39;s profile. Stick to your unique
                            style and be innovative.
                        </p>
                        <p>Upload the final track</p>
                        <p>
                            Remember the listener does not know you
                            personally, and they do not have time to listen
                            to your struggles of becoming number 1.
                            Therefore, record and create as many tracks as
                            you want but always upload the final and best of
                            all.

                            song&#39;s list. Also, share in WhatsApp groups,
                            and you can again ask your friends to help you
                            in spreading the links.

                            If you want your profile to stay alive, you need
                            to be present on your account as well. It means
                            that if the user&#39;s comment, you must be
                            there to respond. Increase the interaction, so
                            the listener feel welcomed on your profile and
                            tracks.

                            amount. Some users think it as a support to
                            their favourite artist.

                            Buy link is a URL of the third party at which
                            your songs will be available for purchase.

                            Now your song is available on SoundCloud, and
                            the users can have it from the URL you have just
                            pasted.

                            However, if anytime you want to change the
                            settings of the previously uploaded songs, you
                            can do it as stated below:

                        <ul type="disc">

                            Premier?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, it is not for every artist on the
                            SoundCloud platform, but you can be one of them.
                            But to the one you need to have 5000 plays and
                            that too from countries such as Ireland, France,
                            New Zealand United States, Australia, Canada,
                            United Kingdom, Netherlands, and Germany.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Nevertheless, for every stream, the artist will
                            only receive the 0.0003$. Do not think of it low
                            because it is far above than other music
                            platforms.
