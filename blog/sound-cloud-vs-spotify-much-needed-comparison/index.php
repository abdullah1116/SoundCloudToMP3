                                These are two main music streams which are
                                running par-to-par for years now. Undoubtedly
                                the competitions are very high, but you should
                                understand that both are dealing in different
                                music markets.&nbsp;
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Most of the time, the comparison is made on the
                                number of users, SoundCloud/Spotify offline,
                                SoundCloud/Spotify playlist downloader, and
                                SoundCloud/Spotify to mp3 conversion.&nbsp;

                                But the comparison doesn&#39;t lead to the right
                                stats because of the different serving criteria
                                both have.&nbsp;

                            <p>
                                When comparing SoundCloud and Spotify downloader
                                applications, we forget to consider the users
                                and their intention.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>SoundCloud&#39;s Audience</p>
                            <p>
                                SoundCloud, as started in Germany, had the goal
                                to give opportunities to low-key artists. Those
                                who do not have other resources and those who do
                                not want to be on the public&#39;s front
                                end.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>
                                Hence, the birth of Underground music took
                                place. Get a better understanding of Underground

                            <p>
                                Now the targeted audience of this application is
                                different as it includes songs of the top
                                artist, who are recognized worldwide. Another
                                limitation the Spotify converter has is the fact
                                that it is not operational in all
                                countries.&nbsp;
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Now you must have understood the primary
                                difference between the two applications.&nbsp;
                            </p>

                                Paying rates of these two popular applications

                            <p>
                                We are now moving to another fundamental point
                                to analyze the difference between SoundCloud and
                                Spotify; monetization.&nbsp;
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Both of these apps pay the artist on the number
                                of streams it gets. However, it will not be
                                wrong to say that the pay rate is not very high
                                as some other streaming applications are
                                offered. But the exceptionally high usage of
                                these apps somehow balances it by getting high
                                streaming.&nbsp;

                                The significant differences between the artist
                                getting pay are

                                    SoundCloud allows the artist to sell their
                                    track, but Spotify doesn&#39;t

                                <li>
                                    Spotify has a higher rate per stream than
                                    that of SoundCloud.
                                </li>

                                Who offers better quality music, SoundCloud, or
                                Spotify?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When comparing the applications based on
                                quality, let us go back to the fact that
                                SoundCloud allows underground music. Hence, the
                                quality fluctuates.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>
                                Since Spotify only deals with famous artists, it
                                has a centralized quality control program. Thus
                                it offers higher quality than SoundCloud.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>Freedom of posting song</p>
                            <p>
                                SoundCloud allows the user to create an account
                                and start posting the songs. However, to post on
                                Spotify, you have to go through several
                                processes. Such as:
                            </p>
                            <ol start="1" type="1">
                                <li>Create an account</li>
                                <li>
                                    Publishing the release date of the track is
                                    mandatory
                                </li>
                                <li>Quality check by DSP by paying the fees</li>
                                <li>
                                    Only the invited artists can publish their
                                    work
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
                            <p>
                                Although both of the platforms, SoundCloud and
                                Spotify, are ideal for the music industry.
                                Nevertheless, Spotify has more users than
                                SoundCloud because of its high-grade
                                quality.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>
                                On the other hand, SoundCloud wins when it comes
                                to publishing your work. Therefore, both apps
                                have distinctive purposes to offer. You can
                                choose the one that suits your needs the best.
